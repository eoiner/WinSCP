# WinSCP
C# Console application for connecting to a remote WinSCP server.

The purpose of this simple application is to demonstrate the use of the WinSCP assembly in a .NET Applicatoin.
Configuration settings for your local machine and remote server are set in the App.Config. You can add and
remove more depending on the requirements of the task. I initially needed this same base to begin automating
documentation transfer between a local system and a remote desitnation.
